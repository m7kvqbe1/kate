## Journey optimisation within a benefits platform

### Overview

A global commercial real estate organisation wanted to improve completion rates during its annual benefits enrolment window.

Previous enrolment data showed that many employees signed in and explored options, but dropped off before submitting selections.

The objective was to improve task completion within the existing digital platform without redesigning the product itself.

The solution needed to focus on content structure, timing and clarity.

### Understanding the Problem

We reviewed platform analytics and previous enrolment data to understand where users were disengaging.

The pattern was consistent:

- Employees signed in
- Viewed benefits
- Delayed decisions
- Failed to complete submission

The issue wasn't access. It was confidence and clarity.

Benefits information was available, but employees were making complex decisions in a short timeframe, often misunderstanding the full implications of their choices.

There was also a measurable increase in helpdesk queries during enrolment, suggesting friction in the decision process.

### My Role

Working alongside the implementation team and the client, I designed and delivered a structured pre-enrolment content programme within the platform.

My focus included:

- Mapping content to the enrolment journey
- Designing a three-month communication runway
- Structuring weekly platform content
- Aligning messaging to key decision stages
- Simplifying benefit explanations
- Reducing ambiguity ahead of the enrolment window

The aim was to support users before they were required to act.

### Approach

#### Designing around the user journey

We structured content around the progression:

**Sign in → View → Submit → Complete**

Each piece of content was designed to support movement through that sequence.

Rather than concentrating communication through a single channel during the enrolment window itself, we introduced a steady cadence in the three months leading up to it. This gave employees time to understand their options before deciding.

#### Reducing cognitive load

Content focused on:

- Clear explanations of individual benefits
- Practical examples
- Reminders of key deadlines
- Direct links to relevant sections of the platform

The emphasis was on clarity and preparation, not promotion.

#### Supporting informed decisions

We used plain language and consistent framing to reduce ambiguity. Where possible, benefits were explained in terms of real-life impact rather than in-depth policy detail.

This helped users understand how benefits can support them in their everyday life, not just what a benefit was or did.

### Outcome

The structured content approach resulted in measurable improvements across the enrolment journey:

- **100% increase** in employees completing at least one benefit purchase
- Employees were **twice as likely** to complete a purchase from sign-in to submission
- **29% increase** in sign-ins
- **30% increase** in benefit views
- **12x fewer** helpdesk queries related to benefits

Completion rates increased from approximately **20% to 39%**.

The work demonstrated that improving clarity and progression within a digital journey can significantly influence task completion without altering core platform functionality.

### What this shows

The results clearly show how clarity and preparation reduce friction. And especially how informed content decisions can help ease this.

By structuring content around the actual user journey, not the user journey defined by product, and by giving employees time to understand their choices, we were able to influence task completion without redesigning the system.

For me, this is content design at its most practical — supporting behaviour change inside an existing digital environment.
