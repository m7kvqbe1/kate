I'm a content strategist and content designer working with SaaS and technology businesses to design and deliver user-centred content that meets the needs, goals and preferences of the end user.

With a background in content marketing and communications, I've been lucky enough to work with some of the world's leading technology brands since 2008.

My core content skills are: discovery and research, content auditing, content strategy, content
governance and operations, content design...

...oh, and I love a journey mapping workshop.
