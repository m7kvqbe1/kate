I'm a content strategist and content designer working with SaaS and technology businesses to break down silos and create exceptional experiences.

With a background in content marketing and communications, I combine research, writing and problem-solving to deliver user-centred content that meets the needs, goals and preferences of real people, not just users. 

My core skills include: user research methodologies, journey mapping, content auditing, content strategy, UX writing and information architecture
